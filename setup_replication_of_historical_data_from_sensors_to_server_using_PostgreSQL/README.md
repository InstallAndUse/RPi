In this project we shall setup replication between PostgreSQL DataBases (DBs) to move historical data of DS18x20 sensors from measurement units to server.

there are many variants to deploy such replication. In my case Dell Latitude laptop with Fedora 31 was used to act as satellite to acquire telemetry from sensors. I shall keep this project open, because there are many other interesting setups to appear, using different operating systems.
